## State machine editing and simulation

Internally uses these projects:
- Awesome `wails` framework because I want to experiment both in Go and Java/TypeScript.
- `xyflow` because it rocks for drawing graphs in JavaScript.
- `state-machine-cat` because it parses SCXML and its own format into an AST object on top of which this project defines its own, executable state machine definition.

Currently just some unit tests for the early version of the state machine execution and contraption POC UI.
Hopefully more to come.

Type `wails dev` to start the useless UI.
