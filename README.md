# strict-state
State machine editing and simulation

Uses awesome wails framework because I want to experiment both in Go and Java/TypeScript.


Currently just some unit tests for the early version of the state machine execution and contraption POC UI.
Hopefully more to come.

Type `wails dev` to start the useless UI.
